# Assignment 1: Implement RPC and RMI in a Cloud Environment

## Task

You are required to implement a **distributed application** using
**Remote Procedure Call (RPC)** and **Remote Method Invocation (RMI)**.
The application must be **hosted and executed in a cloud environment**.

The client should be able to remotely access services provided by the server.

---

## RPC Implementation

Implement an RPC-based application that supports the following:

* Define remote procedures on the server
* Invoke procedures remotely from the client
* Receive results from the server

---

## RMI Implementation

Implement an RMI-based application that supports the following:

* Define a remote interface
* Implement the interface in a remote object
* Register the object with the RMI registry
* Invoke remote methods from the client

---

## Requirements

* Language:

  * RPC: **Java / Python**
  * RMI: **Java**
* Implement both **client and server programs**
* Host the server application in a **cloud environment**
* Proper error handling must be implemented

---

## Expected Output

* Successful remote procedure invocation using RPC
* Successful remote method invocation using RMI
* Correct output returned from the cloud-hosted server

---

## Submission Guidelines

* Push complete source code to this repository
* Include execution screenshots or logs
* Code must be well-commented
* Do not upload cloud credentials

---

# Assignment 2: Create and Distribute a Torrent File in a Peer-to-Peer Environment

## Task

You are required to **create and distribute a torrent file** to share a file in a
**peer-to-peer (P2P) computing environment**.

The assignment demonstrates decentralized file sharing using BitTorrent concepts.

---

## Torrent Creation

The application should support the following:

* Select a file to be shared
* Generate a `.torrent` file
* Configure tracker information

---

## Torrent Distribution

The torrent-based file sharing should support:

* Seeding the file from one peer
* Downloading the file from another peer
* Verifying file integrity after download

---

## Requirements

* Use any **torrent client or library** (e.g., qBittorrent, Transmission)
* Peer-to-peer file sharing must be demonstrated
* Use a local or public tracker
* File integrity verification must be shown

---

## Expected Output

* Successful creation of a `.torrent` file
* Successful file sharing between peers
* Complete and verified downloaded file

---

## Submission Guidelines

* Upload the `.torrent` file (if permitted)
* Include screenshots of seeding and downloading
* Provide a brief description of the P2P setup
* Do not share copyrighted or sensitive data

---

## Learning Outcomes

* Understand RPC, RMI, and distributed systems
* Learn cloud-based application deployment
* Understand peer-to-peer computing concepts
* Gain hands-on experience with torrent-based file sharing

---

### End of Assignments

If you want, I can also:

* Add **marks distribution**
* Convert this into **lab experiment format**
* Simplify wording for **UG students**
* Add **folder structure suggestions**

Just tell me 😊
