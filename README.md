# Assignment: Implement RPC and RMI in an application which has to be hosted in a cloud environment

## Task

You are required to implement a **distributed application** using
**Remote Procedure Call (RPC)** and **Remote Method Invocation (RMI)**.
The application must be **hosted and executed in a cloud environment**.

Each implementation should allow a **client** to remotely access services provided by a **server**.

---

## RPC Implementation

The RPC-based application should support the following:

* Define remote procedures on the server
* Invoke procedures remotely from the client
* Return results from the server

---

## RMI Implementation

The RMI-based application should support the following:

* Define a remote interface
* Implement the interface in a remote object
* Register the object with the RMI registry
* Invoke remote methods from the client

---

## Requirements

* Language:

  * RPC: **Java / Python**
  * RMI: **Java**
* Implement **client and server programs**
* Use standard RPC and RMI libraries
* Host the server application in a **cloud environment**
* Proper error handling must be implemented

---

## Program Structure

* RPC Server
* RPC Client
* RMI Interface
* RMI Server
* RMI Client

---

## Expected Output

* Successful remote procedure calls using RPC
* Successful remote method calls using RMI
* Correct output received from the cloud-hosted server

---

## Learning Outcomes

* Understand RPC and RMI concepts
* Develop distributed client–server applications
* Deploy applications in a cloud environment

---

## Submission Guidelines

* Push complete source code to this repository
* Include execution screenshots or logs
* Code must be well-commented
* Do not upload cloud credentials

---

This now **perfectly mirrors** your Stack & Queue README formatting ✔️

If you want:

* Example operations added (like push/pop style)
* Ultra-simple wording for first-years
* Rubric / marks split

Just tell me 😊
